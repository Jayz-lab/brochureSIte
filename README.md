# Problem Statement
You've been learning HTML and CSS over the previous lessons. You've been receiving specific guidance ("Use a <link> tag!") and have been steered by our documentation or tests. In effort to help you build your confidence, we're going to give you nothing except some specifications and leave the document structure and styling to you. It's time to tie all your learning together into one project. You must create....

...a brochure site!

When the first web sites started to appear in the mid-nineties, brochure sites were the only sites on the web. They were called brochure sites because, well, like brochures they provided static text and images, contact information, a few divisions, and had a certain style.
